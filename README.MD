# TX-Policies
A public repository of our rules and other policies within the server

### Rules
The rules.json file is directly tied to https://txnrp.com/rules, Whenever a new change is made here, it will be reflected on the page above.

### Charges
The charges.json file is used in the MDT to add charges on to a user.

# Making Changes
Anyone is allowed to make a pull requesting adding or amending an existing rule/charge, However its existance needs to be justified and needs to be accepted by an maintainer (in this case Community Executives) of this repository before it can be merged.
